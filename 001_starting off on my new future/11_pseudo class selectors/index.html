  <h3>
    Welcome to Cairns - Great Barrier Reef
  </h3>

  <p id ="Cairns" class ="Cairns">Cairns (pronounced ‘cans’) has come a long way since its beginnings as a boggy swamp and rollicking goldfields port. Heaving under the weight of countless resorts, tour agencies, souvenir shops and a million reminders of its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is unabashedly geared towards tourism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Old salts claim Cairns has lost its soul, but it does have an infectious holiday vibe. The city centre is more boardshorts than briefcases, and you'll find yourself throwing away all notions of speed and schedules here, thanks to heady humidity and a hearty hospitality that can turn a short stroll into an impromptu social event. Fittingly, Cairns is awash with bars, clubs, eateries and cafes suiting all budgets. There's no beach in town, but the magnificent Esplanade Lagoon more than makes up for it; otherwise, the northern beaches are but a local bus ride or short drive away.

  <h3>
    Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park
  </h3>

  <section>
    <p>Nothing can really prepare you for the immensity, grandeur, changing colour and stillness of 'the rock'. It really is a sight that will sear itself onto your mind. The World Heritage–listed icon has attained the status of a pilgrimage. Uluru, the equally impressive Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) and the surrounding area are of deep cultural significance to the traditional owners, the Pitjantjatjara and Yankuntjatjara Aboriginal peoples (who refer to themselves as Anangu).</p>

    <section>
      <p>The Anangu officially own the national park, which is leased to Parks Australia and jointly administered.</p>
      <p>There's plenty to see and do: meandering walks, bike rides, guided tours, desert culture and simply contemplating the many changing colours and moods of the great monolith itself.</p>
      <p>The only accommodation is at the Ayers Rock Resort in the Yulara village, 20km from the Rock. Expect premium prices, reflecting the remote locale.</p>

  <h3>
    Sydney Opera House
  </h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this World Heritage–listed building is Australia's most famous landmark. Visually referencing a yacht's sails, it's a soaring, commanding presence. The complex comprises five performance spaces for dance, concerts, opera and theatre. The best way to experience the building is to attend a performance, but you can also take a one-hour guided tour. Ongoing renovation work, scheduled to be completed in 2021, may disrupt visits.
    </p>
    <p>
    There's also a two-hour 'access all areas' backstage tour ($169), which departs at 7am and includes breakfast in the Green Room.

  <h3>Welcome to The Daintree</h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      The Daintree represents many things: Unesco World Heritage–listed rainforest, a river, a reef, laid-back villages and the home of its traditional custodians, the Kuku Yalanji people. It encompasses the coastal lowland area between the Daintree and Bloomfield Rivers, where the rainforest tumbles right down to the coast. It’s a fragile, ancient ecosystem, once threatened by logging, but now protected as a national park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, the spectacular region from the Daintree River north to Cape Tribulation features ancient rainforest, sandy beaches and rugged mountains. North of the Daintree River, electricity is supplied by generators or, increasingly, solar power. Shops and services are limited, and mobile-phone reception is patchy at best. The Daintree River Ferry carries wanderers and their wheels across the river every 15 minutes or so
